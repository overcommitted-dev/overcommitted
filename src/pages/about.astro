    question: 'What is Overcommitted about?',
    answer: 'Overcommitted is a weekly software engineering podcast hosted by engineers from GitHub. We explore the human side of software development—covering career growth, technical best practices, mental health in tech, and industry trends. Each episode features either deep-dive discussions between our hosts or interviews with industry leaders, authors, and practitioners who share their insights and experiences.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Who should listen to this podcast?',
    answer: "Overcommitted is for anyone working in or aspiring to work in software development. Whether you're a junior developer just starting out, a senior engineer looking to grow into leadership, a career changer transitioning into tech, or an engineering manager wanting to stay connected to the developer experience—there's something here for you. We especially appeal to engineers who appreciate honest, thoughtful conversations about both the technical and personal aspects of our profession."
  },
  {
    question: 'What topics do you cover?',
    answer: 'We cover a wide range of topics including: career development and professional growth, AI and developer productivity tools, technical deep dives, leadership and management, imposter syndrome and mental health, productivity and learning strategies, open source and GitHub workflows, developer advocacy and content creation, accessibility and inclusive design, and product-engineering collaboration.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How is this different from other tech podcasts?',
    answer: "Three things set Overcommitted apart: First, we're active practitioners—our hosts are working software engineers at GitHub, not just commentators. We share real insights from our daily work building software at scale. Second, we blend technical content with personal development, recognizing that being a great engineer is about more than just code. Third, we've built an engaged community of 140+ engineers on Discord who collaborate, share knowledge, and support each other beyond the podcast."
  },
  {
    question: 'How often do new episodes come out?',
    answer: 'We release new episodes weekly. Episodes typically run 30-60 minutes—perfect for your commute, lunch break, or coding session. Subscribe on your favorite podcast platform to get notified when new episodes drop!'
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I be a guest on the show?',
    answer: "We love hearing from potential guests! If you have expertise or experiences to share with our community of software engineers, reach out to us through our contact page. We're especially interested in stories about career transitions, technical deep dives, lessons learned, and perspectives that will help our listeners grow as engineers and professionals."
