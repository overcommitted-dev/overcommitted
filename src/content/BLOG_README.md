   ```
   effective-code-reviews.md
   managing-technical-debt.md
   junior-to-senior-engineer-guide.md
   ```

2. Add frontmatter at the top:
   ```yaml

   description: 'Brief description for SEO and previews'
   publishDate: 2025-10-25
   author: 'Your Name'

# Building Better APIs: Lessons from Production

Over the past few years working on production APIs, I've learned some hard lessons about what makes APIs truly robust and developer-friendly...

## Key Principles

### 1. Design for Your Users
Think about who will be consuming your API...

### 2. Consistency is King
Consistent patterns make APIs predictable...

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Inconsistent naming conventions**
2. **Poor error messages**
3. **Missing documentation**

## Code Example

```javascript
// Good: Clear, consistent API design
GET /api/v1/users/123
POST /api/v1/users
PUT /api/v1/users/123
DELETE /api/v1/users/123
```

## Conclusion

Building great APIs is an iterative process...
