Welcome to the Overcommitted Podcast, where we discuss our code commits, our personal commitments, and some stuff in between. I'm your host this week, Bethany. Join by.

Brittany Ellich (00:11)
I'm Brittany Ellich

Bethany (00:13)
We are a group of software engineers. I guess it's just two of us today. But we initially met working on a team together at GitHub and found a common interest in learning and building cool things. We continue to meet to share our learning experiences and discuss our lives as developers. Whether you're pushing code or taking on new challenges, we're happy you're listening. All right. So since it's just us today, I figured we'd just kind of do casual chat and then...

some like quarter retrospectives and looking forward at the last quarter of the year. one thing I just wanted to chat with you about, you just got back from Cascadia JS, right, Brittany? And I recently got back from GoFuCon, so I thought maybe we'd take a moment to do a little conference recap if there's any like.

trends you're picking up on, any highlights, any lowlights, things like that. Do want to go first since it's probably fresh on the brain?

Brittany Ellich (01:11)
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, I'm excited about this. I think this quarter I attended one conference, which was Cascadia JS, and it was a very cool conference. I feel like it was more just like general web development than super JavaScript specific. Most of the code examples were in JavaScript, but I think a lot of the stuff was really applicable to.

pretty much anybody, which is nice. I feel like I see that a lot more in conferences these days because the actual specifics of languages are a little bit less important. there's just, you it's hard to have a lot of new stuff going on in a lot of them to have a ton of different talks. But yeah, it was a fantastic meetup of the Cascadia community. There were actually fewer folks from Victoria, BC than there are from Vancouver, BC.

than they're normally were. Cascadia is the region of North America that makes up Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. So it's supposed to be a meetup of all the groups, but some folks in Canada didn't want to come down this time, understandably. So they had their own separate meetup, I believe. And so it a lot of folks from Oregon and Washington and from just all over. Some of the speakers were from, you know.

all over the place, Rachel Lee neighbors, they're from London. So that was, you know, pretty far. I think that they were previously a,

Pacific Northwest native, but not living in London. So that's a pretty far way to travel. There was Bree Hall, who I've met at two conferences this year, and I'm probably going to see her at Universe as well. And she came over from, I believe, Atlanta. So yeah, there was a lot of folks from all over, which was nice. Overall, the talks were awesome. It was, I think all my favorite ones were really about MCP, which was kind of cool because I think a lot of the MCP stuff

I sort of paid attention to when it got really popular a couple of months ago and then just didn't really need any of it. So was neat to see how things are changing and evolving there. I gave a talk on removing tech debt with agents, specifically the GitHub Copilot coding agent. And that was really fun. That's a similar talk that I'll be giving in universe in a couple of weeks.

And yeah, it was, it was good. Overall, it was good. It's definitely a conference I could see myself going to year after year. think they had around 600 attendees and it was the most people at a Cascadia JS ever. Not even since COVID now. I think for the last few years, it's been the most since COVID, but now it was the most ever. So that was really cool. They already announced 2026 and it's definitely on my radar for next year. How about you? How was GopherCon?

Bethany (03:50)
Yeah, yeah, GopherCon was great. It was in New York City this year, which is a first for GopherCon, think. Typically, they do swap between Chicago and San Diego, but really cool being in New York. I loved being able to do some sightseeing as well as attend the conference. it was, I feel like for once,

fairly balanced for me for not just diving all in the tech space and getting quickly burnt out, but also some just fun non-tech hanging out, which was great. But I think it was very interesting comparing it to my first GopherCon experience two years ago, which Brittany, you were also at that one. It was wild because I think that first one, was everyone was talking about Wasm.

WebAssembly. And that was really the thing. And this year, there is no mention of it. I think I know the Go team added support for it, but I guess it's just like, not on people's brain anymore. Quite potentially, obviously, the themes were around AI, MCP, some ML stuff, but really mostly AI. And so the

keynotes that the Go team were delivering was largely on, how do we ensure that LLMs are giving quality content back for when they're suggesting Go code? Which, working on Copilot API, I thought that was a super interesting talk on, they called it modernization, because LLMs have a cutoff in their memory.

⁓ and a lot of times an LLM, if you're coding go, we'll recommend practices that aren't really in place anymore or that there's more effective recent practices. Even if you tell it, Hey, use this way of doing things, it will still do the old way. and so they're thinking like doing a, MCP server for, for go ensuring that it's always using the latest.

go SDK knowledge. they also want to make sure that linters have modernization flags, which I see in my editor. I've seen it before even this conference. So I think they're already starting that. So, really cool to, to see how they're thinking through things. And I think honestly, it's interesting to think about, but probably ⁓

It's a huge help for your language if LLMs know it and can program in it well. So I wonder if this is a thought for other languages, but it was kind of a fresh take that I haven't seen yet in the coding space. really cool. Highlights for me, I spoke. Yay, it was fun. It was a lightning talk, which I think was perfect for my first time talking. And I talked about Vim.

because I really enjoyed them. I had a lot of really great feedback, really. People were fairly excited. I only messed up once and I don't think people realized I messed up. So that was great. But that was super one of my highlights. Lowlights leading up, I was like super nervous for it. So that was all I could think about and I wasn't necessarily.

engaged or plugged in with the rest of the conference just because my anxiety was like, but it was, it was still fun. Yeah, I think that's basically it from my experience, but I guess we can pivot now and talk about how did Q3 go? I guess when did Q3 actually end? Like September 1st?

Brittany Ellich (07:33)
No, I think it ends in, it'll, it ends on at the end of September. So it'll end next week, but this episode will come out next week. So it's, it's good timing, but there's still time to finish something if there's something you're really passionate about.

Bethany (07:38)
⁓ okay.

Amazing.

Yay. Okay.

That's good. That's good. Yeah. For those listening, Brittany actually suggested doing this. And I was like, wow, I have not thought about my goals since we did the first episode. So I think this is a really good thing to do a retrospective on, especially wondering like why that happened and things like that. But I don't know if you want to talk about what your goals were first and how that went.

Brittany Ellich (08:13)
Yeah, for sure.

I, so looking at my goals for Q3, I wanted to continue writing my weekly newsletter, run three times per week, read six books, do my daily drawing for one month on weekdays, and focus on reading and less on content creation. And so that is sort of what I, what I did. I was really pivoting because I think earlier this year I was doing a lot of my own writing for my

newsletter and that kind of got pretty... I wanted to make sure that I was like regularly writing things and it got a little bit too much for me so I pivoted my newsletter to be more about sharing existing resources and I actually really like that. I feel like it gives me an excuse to read more and learn from other people so I feel like I got both of the weekly newsletter and the focus on reading more goals done. I did end up reading three times or running three times per week.

for most of it because I had the Spartan race in Seattle a week and a half ago, I think, and I finished it, which was exciting. I survived slightly under the average time even, which was cool. A lot of the things that I just couldn't do like the monkey bars and stuff. So I had to do a little bit of extra running for that, but that was fine.

Overall it was super fun and I'm considering doing that again. It was just a nice way to keep myself running over the summer. Reading six books. I don't know if I did that or not. I listened to a few audiobooks but I feel like when I'm doing digital like e-reading or listening to audio audiobooks I have a really hard time actually tracking what I'm reading because I don't it's not like I'm holding a physical book and able to be like

These are what this is what I finished. So I made it done that I probably did like three or four books. I'd have to go back and look daily drawing for a month. I stopped halfway through August. Actually, I was doing that and it was really fun. But I got burnt out between the art project we have going on right now and.

just work getting a little bit crazy and stuff. So I also took a step back for about a month this quarter and I recognized that I needed it and it felt really good. It was nice to step away and notice that I was feeling, starting to feel a little bit burnt out and just doing less things and now I'm feeling more refreshed and ready to jump back into more things. So overall good quarter. I don't think I've reached every goal but you know I think that having a focus on goals this year has been

Really nice and it's glad that we're coming back to recap and see where we're at. Because it's really easy over the course of a year to forget what it is that you wanted to do.

Bethany (10:59)
yeah, definitely. I agree. Even when you're not achieving those goals, and I think it's good to review, okay, well, why? And being empathetic with yourself, but it sounds like you hit more or less a good portion of your goals. I'm curious with the weekly newsletter, did you see any changes in engagement with it from the change or has it been roughly constant?

Brittany Ellich (11:24)
I think there were quite a few unsubscribes early on because I mean the entire, all the content changed so totally understandable. But since then everything's been, after the first week or two of the change it's been pretty steady. I think a lot of that is likely that, know, some, well actually no, I think I've actually gotten more engagement because now I'm tagging folks that I have, you know, read something and then I'm sharing the things that they're writing which also feels better to me than just like putting all of my own stuff.

out into the void of the internet and it's kind of more fun for me to celebrate some of the things that somebody else wrote and did and that I thought was really good than just trying to share my own thing that I wrote. So I would say it's probably been a positive overall. I think most of the newsletters I'm subscribed to are like a you know something written each week where they you know

It's either like ⁓ an accumulation of links that they're sharing or it's like a thing that they write every single week. And I think I've just realized sort of the niche that I'm in is sharing lots of different things. I don't actually know. This is one thing that I'm not totally sure I'm going to keep doing next year. But I do want to finish it for the year and see like, was this worth it? Or do I just want to go back to writing the occasional blog post when I have something really exciting to talk about? we'll see. Good question.

Bethany (12:40)
That totally makes

sense. And I think that's a really good experiment to have and just seeing what sticks, what feels good to you though is, I think, so important. So I'm glad that you've kind of pivoted and done things that feel true to what your goals are and what you're wanting to put out in the world. So really cool.

Brittany Ellich (12:58)
Yeah, thank you. How did your quarter go?

Bethany (13:02)
Yeah, it was fine. So I think you hopefully pulled my goals, which was good to be reminded about because I think before this, could not even remember what I said. And so my Q3 goals were to get back to creating blog content, which

AI probably messed up a little because I never wrote blog content. I have not done any of this. Honestly, I haven't done the design course or anything like that. I've really fallen off of this. And eventually I do want to get back on it. But I think I've just put so much into work. It's been hard to think about engineering or doing

big brain stuff outside of work. it that that kind of fell off, which I'm OK with. Read regularly. I still have done that. I will probably end up reading about 12 books this quarter. And it's just it almost doesn't feel like a goal because it's just something I enjoy. I like doing. probably haven't done as much tech reading as I typically do.

just because life's been crazy, but I always have a have at least one fiction book and one tech book in progress. So that's been that's been really good. And I also mentioned integrating movement into my routine. Did not happen either. So I'll get back to that maybe later. But yeah, that did not happen.

stop using all my energy at work also did not happen. I have been a workaholic, but I do think in general, when I think about how this last quarter went, I feel like I've been better at developing a community outside of work. So investing in friendships a lot in ⁓ people that I care about and people that care about me. And so I

I feel very lucky about that. And I think it has been a super positive experience this quarter, just getting out there and doing more things. I've been to a couple local concerts, hung out with friends fairly consistently and maintained those friendships. So that's been really good. And I'm proud of myself for that. So I think that's been definitely a net win. And then lastly, I mentioned public speaking efforts.

I did talk at GovrCon, like I mentioned earlier, so I consider that a win. yeah. But so overall, the things I accomplished weren't because I was tracking goals. So it almost feels like cheating to mention that. do think I've had, it's been a positive quarter. I don't think it's been a bad quarter. Anything's just things have been busy.

and I haven't really been organized and focused on, okay, well, what do I want to do? So I end up getting pulled a lot of different directions. And so when I reflect back, I think that's like a large theme of this past quarter is I'm kind of like doing a lot, but it's not necessarily aligned with or focused in things that I'm trying to progress in necessarily.

Brittany Ellich (16:31)
That sense. Yeah, I think that's one reason why I like, you know, pausing every quarter or so just to think about what it is you're doing, just to make sure that the things, I think it's really easy to sort of get stuck into.

I'm gonna keep doing the things that my work asks me to do or keep doing these things that I know are on my plate that I need to get done. And it's kind of nice to stop and think, okay, like am I spending my time in a way that makes me happy so that, you know, at the end of the year, you don't look back and you're like, wow, this entire year sucked. I didn't do anything fun. So I think that's nice to do. Even if you don't end up accomplishing things that you originally set out to do, think it's still good to reflect and think about what it is.

that you're working on. And with respect to the blog content and stuff like that, too, I feel like, you know, wanting to do those things and not actually doing them, like, that's fine. You have a podcast, you did a public talk, you're working on, like, one of the coolest things in tech right now. So, you know, I think that you're you're doing a lot for, like, visibility and all that stuff. So.

Bethany (17:24)
yeah.

I appreciate that. Yeah, I would like to spend more time writing organized thoughts down for things that I believe in, like things that I think about. But I agree, it's not something I necessarily need to urgently do or rush to do. So I like,

If I really want, if the blog was really the thing I wanted, there's frameworks, there's like easy ways to do that. I could do a sub stack or whatnot if that was really the thing. But I just, really want to create something that I'm proud of. And I think learn a new stack and become a little more proficient and empathetic for our friend and friends and things like that. So.

Yeah, I think it's largely learning related, so it's nothing that I need to rush to. But yeah, I agree with wanting to reflect on goals. think you can definitely go very far in the planning direction too. And I think it's important to make sure that there's opportunities for like those serendipitous moments and you're trying a lot of new things, but it's, there's...

gotta be kind of give and take there. So it's good to be a little structured and also good to recognize when things are just a little too intense and you're like, no, I don't have to do this today. I can enjoy the nice weather or like hang out with a friend or things like that. So I agree that coming back to this every quarter has been just so really nice for resetting and being like, well, I didn't do this, this and this and that's okay.

but also how do I do those things? Do I still want to do those things? So in that vein, I guess you wanna chat through what our goals for Q4 are.

Brittany Ellich (19:38)
Yeah, I'm trying to think about what it is that I'm focused on right now to figure out what is worth doing. I do think I'm gonna continue the newsletter that I'm working on. I kind of agreed with myself at the beginning of the year that I was gonna try to do it for a year and see what I thought of it. So this will be the last quarter that I try that first year and see if it's something that I actually really enjoy doing or if it's something that I...

don't want to do quite as much. really like the focus now on sharing other pieces of content because I think that that's just a good way for me to make sure that I'm reading things and like trying to stay abreast of information out there. So I'll probably continue that one. One of the other ones that I want to do is I want to do more movement in general. think I'm really considering taking this yoga instructor course.

next year, not because I'm planning to go start teaching yoga, but it's because it's something like I think it'll be helpful for me to like just focus more on like movement and stuff. think I hit a point where I'm just like, wow, it hurts now to move in certain ways and in ways that I have never been like that before. So

turning to get a little old, guess. Not really, but feeling it and I want to, you know, try to make sure that I'm setting myself up for success as I do actually get old to have good routines for taking care of my body and things like that. And then I think the other one that I want to do is I want to work at a co-working space like once a week. My

brother and I actually are going to do that soon. found one in the area that we live and we're going to go together. He also works remotely in tech and so we're going to encourage each other to both go out and like at least go sit around other humans once a week. And I think that that'll be really nice. I think I had this.

existential crisis recently where I was like, oh my gosh, I've been in my house for five years now and that's a lot of time to be indoors and like away from other humans. And I'm kind of missing that connection, especially after going to all these conferences this year. I'm like realizing like I do actually like to go see humans. Um, so I want to try to do that more.

And then I've got two talks planned for this quarter as well. So I'm probably gonna do those and then prep for next year because doing the conference thing has been really fun and I'm really enjoying it and I wanna do more of it. So those are my goals. What about you, Bethany? What do you got going on?

Bethany (22:08)
I love those and I might still one of yours. Well, so brainstorming ahead of time, I wanted to be very aware that I mean, holidays are coming up. December is November and December are personally just a hugely busy time for me.

I mean between holidays and both me and my husband have the same birthday in December so it's like chaos everywhere but fun chaos I guess. But anyways it's I think it's always challenging to do to commit to too much to over commit if you will. So I want to be aware of that and not not be hard on myself if I don't achieve everything but the things that I

would like to do. And I tried to do more like fun things that will be fun to do and beneficial, but one, I'd like to just be more organized. I mentioned like feeling like things are pulling me or directing where I'm going rather than me deciding to do a thing. So I just want to be more organized to weekly planning both for

home life and work life, and be more explicit about the things I'm committing to and the things that I want to do and how it relates to where I want to be. so really if I can just stick with weekly planning, I'll be happy in that case, just get into the habit of doing that and then adjusting from there. and then I really

I really do want to find enjoyment in activity and be more consistent with that. I keep accidentally paying for class pass, so I'll probably actually use those credits at some point. And then finding something I like to do. I've already been to a couple of classes that have been so fun, like an aerial class. I've done some kickboxing and stuff. So just continuing with that and seeing.

⁓ what kind of movement feels good. I feel you on getting older and wanting to make sure that I'm set up for success and I'm like entering new chapters of my life as prepared physically and mentally as possible. So yeah, the one I want to steal from you is the coworking space. That is so good. Me and my husband pay for our coworking space and we send it sometimes and every time we attend it, we're like,

we should do that more often, we just don't. So maybe setting a goal or putting it in the calendar and saying this is the day I'm going to my co-working space just would be helpful. So I love that one.

Brittany Ellich (24:41)
Yeah, that's a great. Yeah, I'm excited. I think it's one of those things that I'm not going to do unless I'm like specifically setting a goal because it's just so easy to like be in your home when you work from home. But it's also just a great way to, you know, get involved in your local community, have some passive, maybe eye contact with other humans. Yeah.

just get out a little bit more. I'm mostly excited about lunch. There's a really great taco place next to the one that we're going to. So I'm just going to get tacos once a week and that's my reward for peopling is tacos.

Bethany (25:15)
That's amazing.

Yes. What an incredible reward. No, it's similar. Our co-working space is in a part of Charlotte that I really, really love. So it's a cool space and just fun to go to that area. So yeah, I love the community aspect too. That's so important, like the local community and getting involved. So I love that.

Brittany Ellich (25:40)
I feel like that's one of the things that has been sort of consistent this year. One, I've been more involved on Blue Sky and I feel like there really is a community there of people, but also going to all of these conferences, like that is the fun part of engineering is the community aspect. And yeah, I think I just, I want to see a little bit more of it. Cause I think a lot of them are still sort of rebuilding and coming back after, you know, this weird.

crazy fever dream we all had of 2020 and beyond. And so I'm excited to spend more time on the overall developer community, hang out with more people, get to know more people. Yeah. It's one thing that AI can't take away from us.

Bethany (26:17)
That's awesome.

Yes, exactly, exactly. I was thinking the same thing while you were saying that. I'm like, well, you can't really do that with AI. I you can talk to it, but I don't know if it's quite the replacement there. So that makes sense. I don't know if you want to talk about the overcommitted book club or how that's been going at all. I feel terrible that I have not been more plugged in there.

Brittany Ellich (26:27)
True.

Bethany (26:46)
I was super, super excited and then I just got very overwhelmed by life and so I feel terrible about that. But do think that's something that's working for us or do you think it's something that was a cool experiment or should we continue?

Brittany Ellich (27:00)
I think I'd be interested in continuing it if nothing else just for like regular trying to read books, but yeah I also fell off reading it every I think reading a single chapter every week is really hard for me when it comes to book clubs because

I prefer to do all of my reading in like one chunk and like get through a book in like two days and then I forget about it if I read it all at once and then don't come back and then if I try to do it once a week then it just it's it's harder for me to commit to. So we'll see. I will see. think Erica has been the one like continuously sticking with it which makes sense because she also does that with our book club.

at work and she's just wonderful at, you know, being consistent with those sorts of things. So see what she has to say once we get to the end of it. And I do, I don't know, I'm kind of getting to a point too where I'm wondering if I really want to spend much more time reading more tech books. Like I feel like I've hit a lot of the big ones, you know, and they're getting to a point where they're starting to sort of repeat each other, repeat themselves.

I think I might have just like read them all. I might have gotten through all the content and now it's better to spend, especially right now when you know, things are changing so quickly that relying on a book might not be the best source of information now. So I don't know, maybe that's just an excuse for my short attention span, not wanting to stick through an entire book anymore. But yeah, I think I'm kind of evaluating whether or not, you know, maybe a short form book club is a better fit for.

Whatever. I don't know. What do you think?

Bethany (28:39)
I love that. Yeah, that's such a such a good thought. It really a lot of these books do repeat themselves. But I think also, it's the nature of the books we choose. So this is not for the overcommitted book clubs specifically, but like work book clubs. If it's

difficult for people to be super plugged in and engaged when you choose a super complicated and niche book that might actually end up ⁓ delivering more insight. So I think it's just it's tough to get general interest in there when it's something super, super niche or super granular. And I think that's a really good point. Like how how do you solve for that? Do you choose?

this more narrow focus over engagement or do you choose more general content that's easier to follow and having more engagement? Super tough. But I agree that Erica is the goat, the greatest of all time for being consistent and I do not know what we'd do without her. ⁓

Brittany Ellich (29:44)
Mm-hmm.

Bethany (29:45)
Super, super appreciative of her, especially with the workbook. I ended up taking off this book just because it has been a lot to keep up with work and everything. So yeah, super appreciative of her for leading and taking ownership of that. But yeah, we'll have to see. But if anyone listening has any thoughts, please let us know. Any suggestions? Any if you've

let any successful book clubs or have any dream book clubs you'd like to be a part of? Please, please leave it in, I guess, do we have a comment section? I don't know, but drop it somewhere. We'll probably see it. Tag us on blue sky. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Mom and dad Snapchat me. Just let me know there.

Brittany Ellich (30:30)
Join the Discord at overcommitted.dev. You can go join our Discord. Tell us there.

I love that.

Bethany (30:40)
Yeah, well great. I think this was a good discussion on looking forward, looking back, all that stuff. So going on to our fun segment. This was super inspired by my college roommate, ⁓ shout out Lily, who asked me this freshman year, and I cannot stop thinking about this question, but she asked me,

If you could give a TED talk on anything, what would it be? So I'm gonna pivot it to be more tech focused. So if you could give a conference talk on anything, could be as serious or as non-serious as you want. What would it be?

Brittany Ellich (31:16)
Good question. think that, okay, if it is tech related, it would be probably something that has to do with the way that social media has been built and the way that it's impacting...

humans, we just had an episode about this, and the way that I think it can be done better, giving us hope, because I've been doing more and more reading about at Proto and Blue Sky recently. I think that this is the spot where I finally want to get deep into open source commitments and things like that. So probably that. That's a really good question. If it's not tech related, I could probably give a decent talk about earthquake preparedness, because I'm...

just very interested in reading about the Cascadia subduction zone earthquake potential and how to prepare for it, which is completely not tech related at all because we won't have technology at that time. What about you?

Bethany (32:16)
I mean, that's a good thing to be knowledgeable about, I think. There's good dividends there for being prepared for natural disasters. So kudos to you, and I am glad that I don't have to worry about that. At least that I know about. Stranger things have happened. But yeah.

Brittany Ellich (32:23)
Yeah.

Yeah.

Bethany (32:35)
I did not, I came up with this question and did not prepare for it at all. But so this is off the dome. But I think tech wise, kind of tech wise, I would love to give a talk about like identity and tech and like finding your identity. It's been something that I've been thinking about a lot. think early in my career, I definitely code switch a lot.

in terms of maybe acting more masculine or acting a certain way to be heard. And it's not necessarily a way that is authentic to me or that I'd want to be perceived as. So I think it's been definitely a journey of finding who I am, how I want to express myself and

also not be seen as weak, not interpret, oh, feminine equals weak or anything like that. So yeah, it's just been an interesting journey and I'd love to kind of talk through things that I've learned about myself or questions I still have, things that are not fair about the industry or just aren't solvable, yet we continue.

Yeah, yeah, just things like that. I'd say for non-tech things, I would love to give a talk on why Serper is the best mascot in the NFL. And I only have one aspect of evidence, but it is the only mascot in the NFL with an actual record because he did a punt return.

and accidentally touched a life ball, jumped on a life ball in regulation. that is the best though, and very fun. So that would be my talk for stuff that is completely unserious, but very serious.

Brittany Ellich (34:38)
Yes, I'm

convinced. Yeah, you've already got me sold on that, so, agree.

Bethany (34:42)
Yes, I mean it

helps that Oregon doesn't have a football team, I guess. Well, Washington does.

Brittany Ellich (34:47)
Yeah.

Yeah, it's very big over here. Everybody's into soccer, I feel like, on this side of the country, more so than football. But maybe I'm just making that up and it's just the tech people on this side of the country.

Bethany (34:53)
Yoohoo!

I mean, soccer has been like really big in Charlotte recently. I just love sports. I know people get on it a lot and I understand. But also I just like, like getting behind something with a bunch of other people and being excited about stuff. Which I guess Panthers maybe haven't had much to be excited for for a long time. But I still, it's just.

It gets me every time. Can't help. Like there's a win. I'm like, yes, we are going to the Superbowl. and soccer too. So fun.

Brittany Ellich (35:31)
That's awesome. Yeah, I mean, it's yeah.

Yeah, the community behind sports is awesome. There are very few things, especially right now with streaming being so popular, you can go watch any show like ever created whenever you want. So there's very few things that are happening in real time these days. I feel like soccer or sports in general, that's one of them. And that's a great way to have community. One of the only other things that's happening in real time is like current events and politics. And that has done nothing but like divide people. So sports all the way. I don't watch a lot of sports, but I'm pro sports.

Bethany (36:00)
Yeah!

Yay!

Yeah, completely agree. All right.
